#My First Attempt At A ReadMe#
**By Kyle Bachand**
*Drafted 25 September 2023*

##What I'm Trying to Do##
In this ReadMe, I am trying to use a large portion of the basic syntax to appropriately style this document. I am doing all of this to:

1. Make myself more adept at drafting ReadMe files, which I've never done before
2. Get more comfortable within the GitHub environment
3. Because it's fun :joy:

I plan on doing all of this within the GitHub environment located [Here](http://www.github.com)

I will at some point also need to make changes using terminal. I plan on using typical commands like:

`git init`
`git status`
`git commit`
`git pull`
and 
`git push`

It is paramount that I am fully comfortable ==forking, cloning, pushing, creating branches, and deleting branches== within the terminal as well as on github (but mainly in terminal)

I also need to remember that git can be described as the following:

Git
: A Distributed Version Control System (DVCS) that allows developers to collaborate through the tracking of changes.

Enjoy coding!
